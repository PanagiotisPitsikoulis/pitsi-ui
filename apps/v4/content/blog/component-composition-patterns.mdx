Great component libraries aren't just collections of components—they're systems of composition. Here's how pitsi/ui components are designed to work together.

## The Compound Component Pattern

Many pitsi/ui components use compound components. Instead of one monolithic component with many props, you get multiple related components that work together:

```jsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>Content here</CardContent>
  <CardFooter>Footer actions</CardFooter>
</Card>
```

This pattern provides flexibility while maintaining structure. You choose which pieces to use, and they automatically work together.

## Slot Pattern with asChild

Some components support the `asChild` prop, allowing you to replace the default rendered element:

```jsx
<Button asChild>
  <Link href="/about">About</Link>
</Button>
```

This gives you button styling with Link behavior. No wrapper divs, no style conflicts.

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled

Our components support both patterns:

**Uncontrolled**: The component manages its own state. Simpler for basic use cases.

**Controlled**: You manage state externally. Necessary for complex interactions or form libraries.

## Composition Over Configuration

Instead of dozens of props, we favor composition:

```jsx
// Not this
<Input leftIcon={<SearchIcon />} rightIcon={<ClearIcon />} />

// But this
<InputGroup>
  <InputLeftElement><SearchIcon /></InputLeftElement>
  <Input />
  <InputRightElement><ClearIcon /></InputRightElement>
</InputGroup>
```

More verbose? Slightly. More flexible? Absolutely.

## Why This Matters

These patterns mean pitsi/ui components can handle use cases we never anticipated. You're not limited to what we thought of—you can compose solutions to your specific problems.
