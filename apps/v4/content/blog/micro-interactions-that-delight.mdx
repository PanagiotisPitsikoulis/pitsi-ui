The best interfaces feel alive. Not in a flashy, look-at-me way, but in a subtle, responsive way. This feeling comes from micro-interactions—the tiny moments of feedback that acknowledge user actions.

## What Makes a Good Micro-interaction

A great micro-interaction does three things:

1. **Confirms the action** - Did my click register? Did the form submit?
2. **Guides attention** - Where should I look next?
3. **Adds personality** - Is this app friendly? Professional? Playful?

Bad micro-interactions do the opposite: they distract, confuse, or slow users down.

## The Principles

### 1. Respond Immediately

Users expect instant feedback. Any delay longer than 100ms feels sluggish. This is why we use CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations wherever possible—they're hardware accelerated and feel instantaneous.

### 2. Be Subtle

The best micro-interactions are barely noticed consciously. A button that shifts 1-2px on hover. A card that gains a slight shadow when selected. These create a feeling of responsiveness without demanding attention.

### 3. Match the Action

Big actions deserve bigger feedback. Deleting something permanent? That animation can be more dramatic. Hovering over a menu item? Keep it minimal.

### 4. Respect Reduced Motion

Some users find animations disorienting or nauseating. Always honor the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

## Examples in pitsi/ui

### Button Hover States

Our buttons don't just change color on hover—they have a subtle transform:

- Scale up very slightly (1.02x)
- Shift up 1px
- Gain a hint more shadow

This creates a "lifting" effect that feels tactile without being distracting.

### Focus Rings

When users tab through your interface, they need to know where they are. Our focus rings animate in smoothly, drawing attention without jarring.

### Loading States

Skeleton loaders pulse gently, indicating activity. Spinners rotate at a calm pace. Everything says "working on it" without screaming "WAIT!"

### Toast Notifications

Toasts slide in from the edge of the screen, pause for reading, then slide back out. The timing is carefully tuned—long enough to read, short enough not to annoy.

## Implementation Tips

### Use CSS Transitions for Micro-interactions

```css
.button {
  transition: all 0.15s ease-out;
}

.button:hover {
  transform: translateY(-1px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Use Framer Motion for Larger Animations

When you need more control—staggered lists, spring physics, gesture handling—Framer Motion is the right tool:

```tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
/>
```

### Test Without Animations

Periodically disable all animations and use your interface. It should still work perfectly—animations enhance, they don't replace good UX.

## Conclusion

Micro-interactions are the difference between an interface that works and one that feels good to use. They require attention to detail and restraint—the temptation to over-animate is strong. But when done right, they create that intangible feeling of polish that users recognize, even if they can't articulate why.
