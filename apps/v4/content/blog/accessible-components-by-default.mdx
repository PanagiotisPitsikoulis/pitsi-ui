Accessibility isn't an afterthought at pitsi/ui—it's foundational. Every component is built to be accessible from the start, so you can focus on building features instead of fixing accessibility issues later.

## Built on Radix UI

Most of our interactive components are built on Radix UI primitives. This gives us:

**Proper ARIA attributes**: Roles, states, and properties are handled automatically.

**Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard support out of the box. Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys—everything works as expected.

**Focus management**: Focus traps in modals, proper focus restoration, and visible focus indicators.

**Screen reader support**: Announcements, live regions, and proper labeling for assistive technologies.

## What We Add

While Radix handles the behavior, we add:

**Visual focus indicators**: Clear, visible focus states that meet contrast requirements.

**Color contrast**: All text meets WCAG AA contrast ratios. Destructive states, disabled states, everything.

**Reduced motion**: Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Users who need it get a calmer experience.

**Touch targets**: Interactive elements meet minimum size requirements for mobile users.

## Testing Accessibility

We test every component with:

- Automated tools (axe-core, Lighthouse)
- Screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA)
- Keyboard-only navigation
- High contrast modes

## Your Responsibility

While we handle component-level accessibility, you still need to:

- Provide meaningful labels for inputs
- Ensure logical heading hierarchy
- Add alt text to images
- Maintain focus order in your layouts

pitsi/ui gives you an accessible foundation. Build on it thoughtfully.
