Ready to build beautiful interfaces without the design headache? Let's get you set up with pitsi/ui in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18 or higher installed
- A React project (Next.js, Vite, or similar)
- npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun as your package manager

## Installing the CLI

The pitsi/ui CLI is the fastest way to add components to your project. Install it globally or use it directly with npx:

```bash
npx pitsi@latest init
```

This command will:

1. Detect your project type automatically
2. Create a `components.json` configuration file
3. Set up your CSS variables and Tailwind configuration
4. Install required dependencies

## Adding Your First Component

Once initialized, adding components is as simple as:

```bash
npx pitsi@latest add button
```

The CLI will fetch the button component and all its dependencies, placing them directly in your project. You own the code—customize it however you like.

## What's Next?

Now that you're set up, explore our component library. Start with foundational components like Button, Card, and Input, then move on to more complex ones like Dialog, Command, and Data Table.

Welcome to pitsi/ui. Happy building!
