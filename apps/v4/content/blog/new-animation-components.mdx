Today we're releasing our biggest update yet: a comprehensive collection of animation components. These production-ready animations bring your interfaces to life without the complexity of manual animation libraries.

## What's Included

We've added over 20 animation components:

**Scroll Animations**
- Scroll Fade
- Scroll Scale
- Scroll Expand
- Parallax Scroll
- Smooth Parallax

**Text Effects**
- Text Parallax
- Text Gradient Opacity
- Text Along Path

**Interactive**
- Cursor Hover Mask
- Blend Mode Cursor
- Mouse Hover Gallery

**Carousels & Galleries**
- Card Swipe Carousel
- Perspective Carousel
- Floating Image Gallery

**Transitions**
- Perspective Section Transition
- Sticky Footer
- Slide Up/Down

## Built on Framer Motion

All animations use Framer Motion under the hood, giving you:

- Smooth 60fps animations
- Automatic GPU acceleration
- Built-in gesture support
- Spring physics for natural movement

## Easy to Customize

Every animation component accepts customization props:

- Adjust timing and easing
- Modify scroll triggers
- Change animation distances
- Control stagger effects

## Performance First

We've optimized every animation for performance:

- Animations use `transform` and `opacity` only
- No layout thrashing
- Proper `will-change` hints
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
