Dark mode isn't just a preference—for many users, it's essential. Done right, dark mode reduces eye strain, saves battery on OLED screens, and can actually look more sophisticated than light mode. Done wrong, it's a disaster of unreadable text and weird color inversions.

## The Mistakes Everyone Makes

### Mistake 1: Just Inverting Colors

The most common dark mode "implementation" is swapping white backgrounds for black and calling it done. This creates several problems:

- Pure black (#000) backgrounds are harsh and create excessive contrast
- Some colors that work on white look terrible on dark backgrounds
- Shadows become invisible or look wrong
- Images and illustrations clash with the new theme

### Mistake 2: Maintaining Light Mode Contrast

In light mode, you might use a very light gray background with white cards. If you simply darken these, the contrast between them disappears. Dark mode needs its own contrast decisions.

### Mistake 3: Forgetting About Elevation

In light mode, elevation is often shown with shadows. In dark mode, shadows don't work the same way—you need to use lighter surfaces to show elevation instead.

## The Right Way

### Use Dark Gray, Not Black

Start with a dark gray like `#0a0a0a` or `#121212` instead of pure black. It's easier on the eyes and gives you room to go darker for contrast when needed.

### Create a New Color Palette

Every color needs a dark mode variant. Here's our approach:

**Backgrounds**: Multiple levels of dark gray

```
Background: oklch(0.13 0 0)
Card: oklch(0.17 0 0)
Elevated: oklch(0.21 0 0)
```

**Text**: Don't use pure white—it's too harsh

```
Primary text: oklch(0.95 0 0)
Secondary text: oklch(0.65 0 0)
Muted text: oklch(0.45 0 0)
```

**Brand colors**: Slightly desaturate and lighten
Vibrant colors that work on white often look garish on dark backgrounds. Tone them down slightly.

### Show Elevation with Lightness

Instead of shadows, use progressively lighter backgrounds:

```
Base layer: #121212
First elevation: #1e1e1e
Second elevation: #2d2d2d
Third elevation: #3d3d3d
```

This creates the same sense of depth as shadows in light mode.

### Handle Images Thoughtfully

Bright images can be jarring against dark backgrounds. Consider:

- Reducing brightness slightly (we use `brightness(0.95)`)
- Adding subtle borders or background colors
- Ensuring images have appropriate dark mode variants

### Maintain Semantic Color Meaning

Error states should still feel "danger." Success should still feel positive. The hues stay the same, but saturation and lightness adjust:

```
Light mode error: hsl(0, 84%, 60%)
Dark mode error: hsl(0, 70%, 55%)
```

## Implementation in CSS

Modern CSS makes dark mode implementation elegant:

```css
:root {
  --background: oklch(1 0 0);
  --foreground: oklch(0.13 0 0);
}

.dark {
  --background: oklch(0.13 0 0);
  --foreground: oklch(0.95 0 0);
}
```

Using CSS custom properties means your components don't need to know about themes—they just use the variables.

## Testing Your Dark Mode

1. **Use it yourself**. Spend a full day in dark mode. You'll quickly find what doesn't work.

2. **Check in bright light**. Dark mode often fails in sunny environments where screens are hard to see.

3. **Test contrast**. Use tools to verify text remains readable—aim for at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio.

4. **Review all components**. That component you forgot about? It's now blindingly white in your beautiful dark interface.

## Why We Invested So Heavily

Dark mode isn't optional in 2024. Users expect it. Operating systems default to it. We made sure every single component in pitsi/ui has been carefully crafted for both themes.

Toggle between them—you'll notice they feel like two intentional designs, not one design and its awkward inversion.
