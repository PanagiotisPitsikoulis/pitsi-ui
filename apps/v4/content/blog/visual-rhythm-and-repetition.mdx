Music has rhythm. Poetry has meter. Great design has visual rhythm—the consistent repetition of elements that creates a sense of order and flow.

## What is Visual Rhythm?

Visual rhythm is the pattern created when design elements repeat at regular intervals. Just like a drummer keeping time, visual rhythm keeps your interface feeling organized and predictable.

Look at any well-designed interface and you'll notice patterns:
- Cards are the same size
- Spacing between sections is consistent
- Typography follows a clear hierarchy
- Colors repeat intentionally

These patterns aren't accidents—they're the result of deliberate design decisions.

## Types of Rhythm

### Regular Rhythm

The same element repeated at equal intervals. Think of a grid of product cards or a list of menu items. Regular rhythm is easy to scan and feels organized.

### Alternating Rhythm

Two or more elements alternating in a pattern. A checkerboard layout, or sections that alternate between left-aligned and right-aligned content. This creates variety while maintaining structure.

### Progressive Rhythm

Elements that gradually change—getting larger, smaller, lighter, or darker. Hero sections often use progressive rhythm, with type scaling down from massive headlines to regular body text.

## Creating Rhythm in Your Designs

### Use a Grid

A grid is rhythm made visible. When elements align to a grid, they automatically share relationships. Our 6-column layout system ensures everything has a home.

### Establish a Type Scale

Your type scale creates vertical rhythm. When headline sizes relate mathematically to body text, the result feels harmonious:

```
Display: 60px
H1: 48px
H2: 36px
H3: 24px
Body: 16px
Small: 14px
```

### Stick to Your Spacing Scale

Every spacing decision should come from your scale. Random values break rhythm; consistent increments maintain it.

### Repeat Visual Treatments

If one card has rounded corners and a shadow, all cards should. If one section has a gradient background, make it a pattern you use elsewhere too.

## Breaking Rhythm Intentionally

Rules exist to be broken—but intentionally. When everything has rhythm, breaking it creates emphasis:

- A larger card stands out in a grid of equals
- A splash of accent color pops against neutral tones
- Extra whitespace signals importance

The key is contrast. The break only works because there's a pattern to break from.

## Rhythm in pitsi/ui

Our components are built with rhythm in mind:

**Consistent border radius** across all components—no mixing of sharp and rounded corners.

**Unified shadow system** with three levels (sm, md, lg) that repeat throughout.

**Type scale baked in** so headings and body text always relate properly.

**Spacing props** that default to values from our scale.

## The Result

When rhythm is present, interfaces feel professional and trustworthy. Users can predict where to find things. Scanning becomes effortless. The design disappears, and the content shines.

Rhythm isn't exciting—it's foundational. Get it right, and everything else you do will feel more polished. Get it wrong, and no amount of flashy effects will compensate.
