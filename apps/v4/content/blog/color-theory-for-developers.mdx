Color can make or break a design. Yet for many developers, color selection feels like guesswork. Let's demystify color theory and see how pitsi/ui applies these principles.

## The Color Wheel

At its core, color theory starts with the color wheel. Understanding three key relationships helps you create harmonious palettes:

**Complementary**: Colors opposite each other on the wheel. High contrast, high energy.

**Analogous**: Colors next to each other. Harmonious and calming.

**Triadic**: Three colors equally spaced. Balanced but vibrant.

## How pitsi/ui Uses Color

Our color system is built on semantic meaning rather than specific hues:

- **Primary**: Your brand color, used for key actions
- **Secondary**: Supporting color for less prominent elements
- **Accent**: Highlights and focus states
- **Muted**: Background variations and disabled states
- **Destructive**: Error states and dangerous actions

This semantic approach means you can completely change your color scheme by updating a few CSS variables, and everything remains harmonious.

## The 60-30-10 Rule

A classic design principle: use your dominant color 60% of the time, secondary 30%, and accent 10%. Our components follow this naturally:

- Backgrounds and large surfaces use muted/background colors (60%)
- Cards, containers, and secondary elements use secondary tones (30%)
- Buttons, links, and interactive elements use primary/accent (10%)

## Dark Mode Considerations

Every color in our system has a carefully tuned dark mode counterpart. We don't just invert colors—we adjust saturation and brightness to maintain the same visual weight and contrast ratios.
