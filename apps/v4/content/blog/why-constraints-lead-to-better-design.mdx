It seems counterintuitive: how can having fewer options lead to better outcomes? Yet this principle lies at the heart of great design. When everything is possible, nothing is coherent. Constraints force decisions, and decisions create consistency.

## The Paradox of Choice

When faced with unlimited options, we often make worse decisions. This is true for consumers choosing products, and it's equally true for developers building interfaces.

Consider font selection. With thousands of fonts available, how do you choose? Most developers either:

1. Spend hours researching and still feel uncertain
2. Pick something quickly and hope for the best
3. Use whatever's already in the project

None of these approaches leads to optimal outcomes. But if you're limited to a curated set of fonts that work well together? The choice becomes much easier, and the result is more likely to look good.

## How pitsi/ui Applies This

Our component library is built on thoughtful constraints:

**Limited Variants**: Instead of infinite customization, we offer a curated set of variants that cover real use cases. Each variant has been designed to work in its intended context.

**Defined Color Tokens**: Rather than letting you pick any hex color, we provide semantic color tokens. This ensures consistency and makes theming straightforward.

**Standardized Spacing**: Components use spacing from our scale, not arbitrary pixel values. This creates rhythm and coherence across your interface.

## Freedom Within Boundaries

Constraints don't eliminate creativity—they channel it. By removing decisions that don't matter (exactly which shade of gray to use), you're free to focus on decisions that do (how to structure your user's journey).

The best designers understand this intuitively. They create systems—sets of rules and constraints—that make good design the path of least resistance.

## The Developer Benefit

For developers, well-designed constraints are liberating. You don't need to become a design expert. You don't need to agonize over visual decisions. You can trust that the system will produce good results, letting you focus on building great features.

This is the philosophy behind pitsi/ui. We've done the hard work of creating a cohesive, beautiful design system. You get to reap the benefits without years of design study.
