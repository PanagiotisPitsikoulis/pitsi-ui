Today we're excited to announce MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for pitsi/ui. This integration allows AI assistants like Claude to understand our component library deeply, helping you build interfaces faster than ever before.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol is an open standard that allows AI assistants to interact with external tools and data sources. By implementing MCP, pitsi/ui becomes a first-class citizen in AI-assisted development workflows.

## What This Means for You

With MCP integration, you can now:

**Ask About Components**: "What components does pitsi/ui have for forms?" and get accurate, up-to-date answers.

**Get Usage Examples**: Request specific implementation patterns and receive code that actually works with our current API.

**Discover Features**: Learn about component props, variants, and best practices through natural conversation.

## How It Works

Our MCP server exposes:

1. **Component Registry**: Full metadata about every component, including props, variants, and dependencies
2. **Documentation**: Searchable documentation that AI can reference when answering questions
3. **Examples**: Real code examples that demonstrate proper usage patterns

## Getting Started

If you're using an MCP-compatible AI assistant, it can automatically connect to our registry. Simply ask about pitsi/ui components, and the AI will have full context about our library.

This is just the beginning. We're continuing to expand our MCP capabilities to make AI-assisted development with pitsi/ui even more powerful.
