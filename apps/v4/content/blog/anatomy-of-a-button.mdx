The humble button is often the first component developers add to their projects. But don't let its simplicity fool you—a well-designed button component requires careful consideration of many factors.

## The Variant System

Our Button component supports multiple variants, each serving a specific purpose:

**Default**: The primary action button. Use it for the main call-to-action on any page or form.

**Secondary**: Less prominent than default but still clearly clickable. Perfect for secondary actions.

**Outline**: A bordered button that doesn't compete for attention. Great for cancel buttons or tertiary actions.

**Ghost**: Minimal styling that blends with surrounding content. Ideal for icon buttons or inline actions.

**Destructive**: Red-tinted to signal danger. Use sparingly for delete or irreversible actions.

## Size Considerations

We offer four sizes: `sm`, `default`, `lg`, and `icon`. Each is designed for specific contexts:

- **sm**: Compact interfaces, inline buttons, or mobile-first designs
- **default**: Standard use cases, forms, and most interfaces
- **lg**: Hero sections, landing pages, or when you need visual impact
- **icon**: Square buttons for icon-only use cases

## Accessibility First

Every variant maintains WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. We ensure:

- Minimum contrast ratios for all color combinations
- Focus states that are visible across all variants
- Proper disabled states that communicate unavailability
- Full keyboard navigation support

## The Technical Implementation

Under the hood, we use `class-variance-authority` (CVA) to manage our variant system. This approach gives us type-safe variants with excellent DX while keeping the bundle size minimal.
