Forms are where users interact most closely with your application. A poorly designed form can tank conversion rates and frustrate users. Here's how to build forms that people actually enjoy using.

## Start with Structure

Good form design starts with thoughtful structure:

**Group related fields**: Name fields together, address fields together. Users should never wonder where to look next.

**Use logical order**: Follow natural reading patterns. For Western audiences, left to right, top to bottom.

**Minimize field count**: Every field is friction. Question whether each one is truly necessary.

## Validation Done Right

Validation should help, not punish. Here's our approach:

**Validate on blur**: Don't show errors while users are still typing. Wait until they move to the next field.

**Use inline errors**: Error messages should appear right next to the problem, not in a list at the top.

**Be specific**: "Invalid email" is unhelpful. "Please include an @ symbol" tells users exactly what to fix.

## The Power of Defaults

Smart defaults reduce user effort:

- Pre-fill country based on locale
- Default date pickers to today
- Remember previous selections when appropriate
- Use placeholder text sparingly and meaningfully

## Accessibility Essentials

Our Form components handle the basics, but here's what to remember:

- Every input needs a visible label (not just placeholder text)
- Error messages must be programmatically associated with their inputs
- Use `autocomplete` attributes for faster form filling
- Ensure the form is fully keyboard navigable

## Progressive Enhancement

Start with native HTML form elements. They're accessible, keyboard-friendly, and work without JavaScript. Then enhance with client-side validation and better UX. Your forms should work even if JavaScript fails.
