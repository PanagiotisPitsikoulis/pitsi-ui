We're thrilled to announce that pitsi/ui now fully supports React 19! This update brings improved performance, better server component compatibility, and access to all the latest React features.

## What's New

React 19 introduces several exciting features that pitsi/ui now leverages:

**Server Components**: Our components work seamlessly in both server and client contexts. Most components are server-compatible by default.

**Actions**: Form handling is now simpler than ever with React 19's Actions API. Our Form components integrate naturally.

**Use API**: The new `use` hook works perfectly with our async patterns and data fetching components.

## Upgrading

If you're on React 18, upgrading is straightforward:

1. Update your React dependencies to version 19
2. Run `npx pitsi@latest diff` to check for any component updates
3. Update any components that have changed

Most components require no changes at all. We've ensured backward compatibility while taking advantage of new features.

## Looking Forward

React 19 opens up new possibilities for component design. Expect more server-first components, better streaming support, and improved developer experience in upcoming releases.
