When people think about typography hierarchy, they think about size. Big text = important, small text = not important. But size is just one tool in the hierarchy toolkit, and overusing it leads to awkward designs with text that's either too big to read comfortably or too small to notice.

## The Hierarchy Toolkit

### 1. Size

Yes, size matters—but subtlety is key. Each step in your scale should be distinct enough to notice but not so dramatic that it looks like a ransom note.

A good type scale might be:

```
Body: 16px
Large: 18px
H3: 20px
H2: 24px
H1: 30px
Display: 48px
```

Notice how the jumps get bigger as you go up? That's intentional—small sizes need smaller increments to feel different; large sizes can handle bigger jumps.

### 2. Weight

Font weight is underutilized for hierarchy. A bold 16px heading can stand out more than a regular 20px heading, while taking up less space and feeling more integrated with the surrounding text.

Our weight hierarchy:
- **900 (Black)**: Display text, hero headings only
- **700 (Bold)**: Primary headings, emphasis
- **600 (Semibold)**: Secondary headings, subheads
- **500 (Medium)**: Labels, navigation
- **400 (Regular)**: Body text
- **300 (Light)**: Secondary information (use sparingly)

### 3. Color/Opacity

Not all text needs to be the same darkness. Use color to create hierarchy without changing size or weight:

```css
--text-primary: oklch(0.13 0 0);   /* Main content */
--text-secondary: oklch(0.45 0 0); /* Supporting text */
--text-muted: oklch(0.65 0 0);     /* Tertiary info */
```

### 4. Spacing

The space around text signals its importance. Headlines deserve generous margins. Captions can be tighter. A heading with 48px of space above it feels more important than the same heading with 24px.

### 5. Letter Spacing

Wider letter spacing makes text feel more prominent (good for headings in all caps). Tighter spacing creates density and urgency. Our display text uses slightly tighter tracking; body text stays at default.

## Combining the Tools

The magic happens when you combine these tools thoughtfully:

**Hero Headline**
```css
font-size: 48px;
font-weight: 900;
letter-spacing: -0.02em;
color: var(--text-primary);
```

**Section Heading**
```css
font-size: 24px;
font-weight: 700;
letter-spacing: -0.01em;
color: var(--text-primary);
```

**Card Title**
```css
font-size: 16px;
font-weight: 600;
color: var(--text-primary);
```

**Card Description**
```css
font-size: 14px;
font-weight: 400;
color: var(--text-secondary);
```

**Metadata**
```css
font-size: 12px;
font-weight: 500;
color: var(--text-muted);
text-transform: uppercase;
letter-spacing: 0.05em;
```

## Common Mistakes

### Too Many Levels

If you have more than 5-6 levels of hierarchy, your users can't track them all. Simplify.

### Size-Only Thinking

Relying solely on size leads to headings that are either comically large or too similar to body text. Use weight and color too.

### Inconsistent Application

If your H2 is sometimes bold and sometimes semibold, users can't learn your visual language. Be consistent.

### Forgetting Line Height

Different sizes need different line heights. Headlines can be tighter (1.1-1.2); body text needs room to breathe (1.5-1.7).

## Testing Your Hierarchy

### The Squint Test

Squint at your page until you can't read the text. Can you still see the hierarchy? Are the important things more prominent?

### The Scan Test

Look at your page for 5 seconds. What did you notice first? Second? Third? Is that the order you wanted?

### The Context Test

Take a screenshot and shrink it to 50%. Does the hierarchy still work? This simulates how users actually perceive your page.

## Our Approach

In pitsi/ui, we've baked typography hierarchy into our components:

- Card titles use semibold, descriptions use regular secondary text
- Dialog headers are bold, descriptions are muted
- Badges use small, medium-weight, uppercase text

You get correct hierarchy by default. And because it's all controlled by CSS variables, you can adjust the entire system if your brand demands something different.
