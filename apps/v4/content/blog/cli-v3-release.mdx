The pitsi CLI v3 is our biggest CLI update yet. Faster, smarter, and more helpful—here's everything that's new.

## Speed Improvements

Component installation is now up to 3x faster. We've optimized:

- Dependency resolution (parallel fetching)
- File writing (batched operations)
- Registry communication (better caching)

Adding a component that used to take 5 seconds now takes under 2.

## New Commands

**`pitsi diff`**: Compare your local components against the registry. See exactly what's changed and decide whether to update.

**`pitsi search`**: Find components without leaving your terminal. Fuzzy search across names and descriptions.

**`pitsi info`**: Get detailed information about any component—dependencies, file locations, and more.

## Better Error Messages

We've rewritten every error message to be:

- **Specific**: Tells you exactly what went wrong
- **Actionable**: Includes steps to fix the issue
- **Contextual**: Shows relevant file paths and configurations

No more cryptic errors. If something fails, you'll know why and how to fix it.

## Framework Detection

The CLI now automatically detects your framework and configures itself appropriately. Next.js, Vite, Remix, Astro—it just works.

## Migration from v2

Most projects need no changes. Run `npx pitsi@latest` and you'll get v3 automatically. If you have custom configurations, check our migration guide for any breaking changes.

## What's Next

We're already working on v3.1 with AI-assisted component suggestions and improved TypeScript support. Stay tuned!
